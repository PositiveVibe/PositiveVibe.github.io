<a class=anchor href=#summary>#</a></h2><p>For the launch project as part of the GIX program, the GIX team partnered with UW-spinoff <a href=http://battgenie.life target=_blank rel=noopener>BattGenie</a> to develop a use-case & market entry point for the nascent technology.</p><p>The GIX team developed a prototype Energy Storage System (ESS) and Battery Management System (BMS) for Lithium-ion batteries.

They <a href=https://battgenie.life/technology/ target=_blank rel=noopener>explain it on their own site</a> better than I could, with graphics and everything. It&rsquo;s worth checking out if you&rsquo;re interested.</blockquote><h2 id=problem-space>Problem Space
<a class=anchor href=#problem-space>#</a></h2><p>Global efforts to mitigate climate change through both e-mobility and energy storage face key barriers with Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries: uncertain performance, limited asset life, and end-of-life costs.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt01.png alt="Graphic showing how the renewable energy storage market is projected to be a 550 billion dollar industry."><figcaption>ICE: Internal Combustion Engine. Re-using batteries and giving them a second life allows us to maximize the CO2 benefit.</figcaption></figure></p><p>By collecting accurate data on historical usage & degradation using a novel physics-based battery management model, this project facilitates a circular economy for Li-ion batteries: repurposing retired Li-ion batteries into second-life energy storage systems can simultaneously save costs and reduce carbon emissions.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt02.png alt="Battery Health vs Battery Life"><figcaption>A battery that can only hold 80% of its charge might not be good for vehicles going up hills, but it can still store energy from the sun, wind, or the grid.</figcaption></figure></p><blockquote class="book-hint warning"><strong>Did you know?</strong><br>The difference between the carbon emissions savings of an electric vehicle vs a gas vehicle is only ~9-23%<a href=#references title=reference>[1]</a>. That assumes they are both driven to 100,000 kilometers. This is because there is an environmental impact to make the batteries in the EV. By getting a second life for those batteries in a less-intensive context, the carbon savings from the EVs are increased.</blockquote><p>In order to move to the future we envision there is currently a lack of data that would show how this could be done.<figure><img src=/img/school/batt03.png alt="Current repurposing pipeline: non-existant."><figcaption>After their first life, EV batteries can be repurposed to store energy for 10 more years.</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=solution>Solution
<a class=anchor href=#solution>#</a></h2><p>To address this problem, my team built a scalable framework to collect battery usage data & provide actionable repurposing insights. This involved the development of an ESS, data collection pipeline, configurable dashboard UI & battery management system (BMS).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt04.png alt="BatteREuse repurposing pipeline: existant."><figcaption>Our hardware-agnostic data pipeline facilitates the repurposing of second-life ESS.</figcaption></figure></p><p>The BMS incorporates BattGenie&rsquo;s novel physics-based battery control algorithm, which provides accurate parameter estimation and lifespan extension compared to industry standards.</p><p>The GIX launch project is extensible to a second-life energy storage deployment, and may power the data collection for an Energy Storage System (ESS) to be used in a load-leveling & demand reduction for a local utility.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt1.png alt="Foreground: user looking at BatteREuse dashboard. Background: Li-ion batteries with BMS attached."><figcaption>Our solution being used by a hypothetical energy engineer. Fun fact: that's me, I am the hypothetical engineer.</figcaption></figure></p><p>Extensive market & user research narrowed the focus to second-life applications: repurposing from e-transit into something that could plug into the grid. A wide variety of applications were evaluated, first focusing on e-bikes, but ultimately leveraging a partnership with a transit agency.</p><p>The team performed 20+ subject matter expert interviews with a wide variety of stakeholders across the battery lifecycle, including: cell manufacturers, system integrators, fleet owners, energy storage experts, second life battery repurposers, utilities, and recyclers. Based on these insights, the team refined business value proposition, and developed a prototype BMS with a customer-facing dashboard through two rounds of usability testing.</p><h2 id=hardware>Hardware
<a class=anchor href=#hardware>#</a></h2><p>The hardware was chosed to showcase the proof-of-concept of BattGenie&rsquo;s idea. To that end we needed a battery pack to use with BattGenie&rsquo;s algorithm. We chose Samsung 18650 3.6V cells to mimic what&rsquo;s going on inside King County Metro&rsquo;s electric bus battery packs. We needed a way to measure the current and voltage, and a way to stepdown the battery back because strung together like that gives it 54V. The Arduino allowed send the data to the Raspberry Pi. It was all enclosed in an aftermarket pack and screwed into a breadboard for easy wiring.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt3.png alt="Hardware diagram showing the battery pack, power supply, current sensor, voltage reader, and Arduino."><figcaption>Hardware diagram showing the battery pack, power supply, current sensor, voltage reader, and Arduino.</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=software>Software
<a class=anchor href=#software>#</a></h2><h3 id=data-pipeline>Data Pipeline
<a class=anchor href=#data-pipeline>#</a></h3><p>The data that would be useful to monitor originated from the batteries. There were 13 strings of batteries with 4 batteries in each string. The batteries were read by a voltage sensor and a current sensor. This was processed on the Arduino and then sent to the Raspberry Pi.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt4.png alt="Software diagram showing how the data was processed and at which point it left the battery packs, went to a local machine, and then off to the cloud to be later viewed by the user."><figcaption>Software diagram showing how the data was processed and at which point it left the battery packs, went to a local machine, and then off to the cloud to be later viewed by the user.</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=user-interface>User Interface
<a class=anchor href=#user-interface>#</a></h3><p>The user interface was a Grafana implementation that showed the current, voltage, and temperature of the batttery packs. It also showed the output from the BattGenie algorithm. The data was user tested with BattGenie to verify it was what they wanted.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/school/batt2.png alt="The user interface showing pack and series voltage, current, temperature, power, state of charge and the raw data table."><figcaption>The user interface showing pack and series voltage, current, temperature, power, state of charge and the raw data table.</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=roadmap-for-battgenie>Roadmap for BattGenie
<a class=anchor href=#roadmap-for-battgenie>#</a></h2><p>Our project was a prototype and an attempt at paving the way forward for Battgenie. They were able to secure some funding and you can find more about their future plans on their <a href=http://battgenie.life target=_blank rel=noopener>website</a>.</p><h2 id=my-specific-contributions>My Specific Contributions
<a class=anchor href=#my-specific-contributions>#</a></h2><h3 id=data-pipeline-1>Data pipeline
<a class=anchor href=#data-pipeline-1>#</a></h3><p>I did the most work on the data pipline and getting the hardware to talk nicely with each other. This included everything from the current and voltage sensors interfacing with the Arduino, to sending that data to the Raspberry Pi and saving it in a local PostgreSQL DB. It also involved setting up the AWS EC2 instance and saving the data into a Timescale DB, which was necessary for the type of data we were working with and to display it properly in Grafana.</p><h3 id=stakeholder-analysis--market-fit>Stakeholder analysis / Market Fit
<a class=anchor href=#stakeholder-analysis--market-fit>#</a></h3><p>As a group, we did a lot of stakeholder analysis for the different markets that we were considering as an entry point for this technology. We were thinking eBikes at first, but it turned out that the market forces weren&rsquo;t right for our project. We all interviewed with SMEs in a variety of positions to get their idea of market viability.</p><h3 id=what-i-didnt-do>What I didn&rsquo;t do
<a class=anchor href=#what-i-didnt-do>#</a></h3><p>Once the data was in Grafana, I didn&rsquo;t spend much time setting up the user views. That was the task for another teammate. Another thing I didn&rsquo;t spend much time with was the battery pack. Including putting it together and setting up the voltage and current readers to the battery pack.</p><h2 id=references>References
