As an intern, my primary responsibility was to research and write SEO content to help the website rank higher on search engines. I learned a lot about search engine optimization and how to write content that is both engaging and informative.</p><p>After I graduated, I was given the opportunity to become the first employee of the company. It was an exciting time as I got to see the website grow and evolve. My roles were diverse, and I had the opportunity to work on different projects.</p><p>As the SEO Manager, I led a team of writers who generated leads and wrote about relevant issues to attract links to the website. Unfortunately, our organic SEO efforts were greatly impacted by Google&rsquo;s algorithm changes. It was a challenging time as we had to rethink our strategies and pivot the company&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>One of the most notable projects was redesigning the website&rsquo;s look and feel, which led to a 10% overall CTR and a 30% increase in revenue. It was rewarding to see the impact my work had on the company.</p><div class="book-columns flex flex-wrap"><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><figure><img src=/img/work/at1.png alt="Old Homepage"><figcaption>Old Homepage</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/work/at12.png alt="Old Directory Page"><figcaption>Old Directory Page</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/work/at13.png alt="Old Listing Page"><figcaption>Old Listing Page</figcaption></figure></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><figure><img src=/img/work/at2.png alt="New Homepage"><figcaption>New Homepage</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/work/at22.png alt="New Directory Page"><figcaption>New Directory Page</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/work/at23.png alt="New Listing Page"><figcaption>New Listing Page</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Despite our best efforts and the 30% increase, the company couldn&rsquo;t generate enough revenue to sustain our team, and I was let go. It was a difficult experience, but it taught me a valuable lesson about the harsh realities of the startup world. I learned how to adapt to changes quickly and work under tight deadlines.</p><p>Overall, my time at AllTreatment.com was a valuable learning experience. I gained experience in SEO, content creation, and website design. It was challenging, but I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such a great team.
