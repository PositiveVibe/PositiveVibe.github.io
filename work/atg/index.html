<a class=anchor href=#creating-ads-seen-by-millions>#</a></h2><p>As a Front-End Web Developer at ATG, my main responsibility was to analyze industry trends and lead the implementation of CRO initiatives.

<a class=anchor href=#promo-tools>#</a></h2><p>One of my notable accomplishments was the development of Promo-tools, a dynamic ad template generation system that ran inside our affiliate portal. As the only developer of the project, I was responsible for seeing this product through to launch. I also played a crucial role in the development of Senderella, a CRM suite that became our primary internal resource for user engagement and retention. My responsibility was to code the template management feature.</p><h2 id=new-mobile-join-form>New Mobile Join Form
<a class=anchor href=#new-mobile-join-form>#</a></h2><p>Another project that I worked on was the Join Application, which allowed A/B testing on the new member funnel for over 2000 white labels. I was responsible coding out the new <strong>mobile</strong> front-end.</p><p>The results of the project increased the CTR for the new join form by 10% and as a result was pushed across all white labels and has netted millions of dollars at this point.</p><h2 id=general-creative-development-and-ab-testing>General Creative Development and A/B Testing
<a class=anchor href=#general-creative-development-and-ab-testing>#</a></h2><p>Furthermore, I created ad/funnel optimization roadmaps to deliver consistent growth against key performance metrics. I utilized big data tools such as Tableau, Splunk, GA, and internal revenue tracking systems to audit our creatives and rotations. I also defined and reported on KPI&rsquo;s for new funnels and campaigns, and planned and implemented hundreds of user and A/B tests to optimize the conversion rate on landing pages, funnels, and pre-rolls.</p><p>The biggest daily respobility of the Creative Developer, is to design, code, publish, and optimize digital creatives, funnels, and campaigns. I led ideation and brainstorming sessions on strategy and design, owned the design, development, and optimization of hundreds of high-traffic creatives, created user flows, wireframes, high fidelity design comps, and interactive prototypes for business and engineering, optimized code and assets for load times, data usage, and search engines, and edited and optimized video for pre-rolls and ads. I also managed and reported on multi-million dollar display ad campaigns with over 30+ million unique impressions/day, released creative assets onto multiple private global CDN networks via a complex GIT command line driven release process, and QA&rsquo;d all creatives on devel and staging environments prior to deploying.</p><h2 id=thank-you-atg>Thank you ATG
