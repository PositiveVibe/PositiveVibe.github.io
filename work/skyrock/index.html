<a class=anchor href=#steam-projects-for-students-age-7-14>#</a></h2><p>After graduating from Tsinghua in October 2020, I was living in Taipei. I had been going to the hot yoga studio there frequently, and one time I was chatting with another person about how I just graduated and was looking for an engineering job. Someone else overheard our conversation, and it turns out they worked for a startup that was looking for engineers! That startup was Skyrock Projects.</p><p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect, is that I would be creating curriculum and teaching students ages 7-14. Skyrock is an after-school and summer/winter camp program that focus on <strong>S</strong>cience, <strong>T</strong>echnology, <strong>E</strong>ngineering, the <strong>A</strong>rts, and <strong>M</strong>ath.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>Skyrock&rsquo;s Mission</strong><br><em>As teachers of mathematics and science in the United Kingdom and Taiwan for many years, we have discovered that the school&rsquo;s education methods that focus on textbooks, examinations and theory are stifling the curiosity of children. Let children give full play to their creative potential in an environment where they use both hands and brains to lay a solid foundation for adapting to the challenges of the 21st century.</em> - <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031030/https://www.skyrockprojects.com/about-us>SkyrockProjects.com, October 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id=what-i-was-hired-to-do>What I was hired to do
<a class=anchor href=#what-i-was-hired-to-do>#</a></h2><p>I was hired to be the IoT and coding specialist, teaching and developing curriculum for the teenagers. I was also available for any tutoring for teenagers that needed guidance for projects to use on their college applications.</p><p>This was great and lasted about 4 months. Then disaster struck.</p><h2 id=covid-19>Covid-19
<a class=anchor href=#covid-19>#</a></h2><p>Up until this point, Taiwan had handled Covid-19 pretty well. Masks were worn inside any public place, and there were a low number of infections. In May of 2021, Covid numbers began to go up. With a mostly unvaccinated and aging population, the government recomended people stay at home. This was right before the big summer camp rush (lots of $$ for the startup, the biggest moneymaking season). The summer was booked up with students who signed up to take STEAM summer camps.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/work/skyrock02.png alt="Covid Deaths in Taiwan"><figcaption>Covid Deaths in Taiwan courtesty of [Worldinfo](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/taiwan/).

There was no clause in the student contracts that said the camps would transition online in case of a government shutdown. The company had to quickly take something they had done in the past, the STEAM box, and iterate on the idea to make a super STEAM box with a whole week&rsquo;s worth of projects.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/work/skyrock03.jpeg alt="Covid Deaths in Taiwan"><figcaption>Covid Deaths in Taiwan courtesty of [Worldinfo](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/taiwan/).

They had already made had a Kickstarter for a STEAM box in July of 2020, before I had arrived at the company. Now we needed a whole week&rsquo;s worth of projects in that box. And I got to be at the center of that transition.</p><h2 id=what-i-actually-did>What I actually did
